# Visual Studio Snapshot Debugger Docker Images

This repository contains Dockerfiles that demonstrate how to set up the Visual Studio Snapshot Debugger on Docker images.

## What is the Visual Studio Snapshot Debugger?

The Visual Studio Snapshot Debugger is a feature of Visual Studio that allows you to take snapshots and to create log statements of in-production ASP.NET Azure
applications without interupting them. Please see https://aka.ms/snappoint for more infomration regarding the Visual Studio Snapshot Debugger.

## Dockerfiles

The Dockerfiles are organized according to the ASP.NET Core major and minor version, the OS platform, and the platform architecture.
For example, the ASP.NET Core 2.2 Alpine 3.8 x64 Dockerfile is located at /2.2/alpine/amd64/Dockerfile. When built, this Dockerfile produces
an image with Alpine 3.8 x64 as the base with ASP.NET Core 2.2 Runtime and the latest supported Snapshot Debugger backend package and vsdbg package.

The Dockerfiles do not take a dependency on the Docker build context, thus they can be built without specifying a build context when executing "docker build".
